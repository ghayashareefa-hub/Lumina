        <h1>Welcome To Lumina Ceramics</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our lumina ceramic studio where earth, fire, and imagination come together. 
          Each piece is thoughtfully designed and hand-crafted, shaped slowly and finished with 
          care so no two are ever exactly alike. From everyday vessels to one-of-a-kind statement 
          pieces, our ceramics are made to be used, loved, and lived with. We believe in honest 
          materials, timeless forms, and the quiet beauty of handmade work created to bring warmth,
          texture, and meaning into your space.

        <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Handcrafted</li>
            <p>Every piece is carefully handcrafted, not mass-produced.
              We embrace small variations in shape, texture, and glaze 
              marks of authenticity that make each ceramic truly one
              of a kind. 
            </p>
            <li>Premium Quality</li>
            <p>We use high-quality clay and durable, food-safe glazes to
              ensure our ceramics are as functional as they are beautiful.
              Each item is fired and finished with precision to stand 
              the test of time.
            </p>
            <li>Made to be used and loved</li>
            <p>Our ceramics aren't just decorative; they're made for daily
              rituals. Coffee mornings, shared meals, quiet moments—our 
              pieces are meant to become part of your story. 
            </p>
            <li>Sustainable Practices</li>
            <p>We work in small batches, minimize waste, and value 
              responsible sourcing—because creating beautiful objects 
              shouldn't come at the expense of the environment.
            </p>
            </ul>

    <section class="Our-story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Our studio began with a simple love for clay and the process of making things by hand.
        What started as quiet hours at the wheel learning, experimenting, and embracing 
        imperfections—slowly grew into a space where creativity and craftsmanship could thrive.
        Inspired by natural forms, everyday rituals, and the beauty of slow living, we create
        ceramics that feel both timeless and personal. Each piece reflects our belief that 
        handmade objects carry warmth and meaning, shaped not only by skill but by patience,
        intention, and care. We value thoughtful design, honest materials, and the rhythm of 
        the handmade process—from raw clay to finished form. Our journey continues with every 
        firing, every glaze test, and every piece that finds a home. This studio is more than 
        a workspace; it's a reflection of our story, our values, and our dedication to creating
        ceramics meant to be used, loved, and lasting.
